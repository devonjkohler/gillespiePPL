# gillespiePPL
The Gillespie algorithm implemented in different probabilistic programming languages. This repository contains simple implementations of gillespie in the corresponding PPLs. This is mainly a proof of concept to see if it is possible to run inference on a Gillespie based model using each language. Given the implementation is possible, we should be able to define priors over the model's rate parameters and learn the posterior, given some simulation or experimental data.
