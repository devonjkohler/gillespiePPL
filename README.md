# gillespiePPL
The Gillespie algorithm implemented in different probabilistic programming languages. This repository contains (very) simple implementations of gillespie in the corresponding PPLs. This is mainly a proof of concept to see if it is possible to run inference on a Gillespie based model using each language. Given the implementation is possible, we would ideally leverage existing simulators which use very efficient implementations of Gillespie, rather than implement the algorithm from scratch.

## PPLs

1. Pyro
2. pyprob
